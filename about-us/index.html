    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
        HairIdentifierSpray.com is an independent review site focused on hair identifier sprays, dermaplaning prep mists, and related tools. 
        We test products hands-on when possible, aggregate verified user feedback, and track live prices so you can make a faster, smarter purchase decision.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our recommendations are based on clear, repeatable criteria: visibility (how well the spray highlights fine hairs), irritation potential, ingredient safety, value, and real-user experience. 
        For transparency, testing notes and scoring methodology are linked on each product review page.
    </p>
    <p>
        We use affiliate links on this site — which may earn us a commission at no extra cost to you — and that helps fund future testing and site maintenance. Full disclosure is in the footer.
